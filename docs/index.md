## Introduction
This project is for users to quickly deployed their object detection application. The backend used [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) for object detection. The release now can only used the built in object detection trained by Google. In the future release, we will add [Google AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl) to fulfill costumed needs.

## Classes
The library contain two classes for use:  

* [Detection](/GC-Detection/Detection)  
    Get the images with bounding boxes on it.
      
* [Interface](/GC-Detection/Interface)  
    This class supports the GUI interface for the detection images and allows user to upload images to [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

## Installation
